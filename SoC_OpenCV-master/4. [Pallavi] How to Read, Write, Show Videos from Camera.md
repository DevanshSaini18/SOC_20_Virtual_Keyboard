## How to read display and save videos using cameras:
```
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0);                       

while(True):                                     

ret, frame = cap.read()                          

cv2.imshow('frame', frame)

if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):            
break                                          

cap.release()                                    
cv2.destroyAllWindows()                        

```

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0);                       #to capture live stream from the default camera, VideoCapture is a class and we create an object of it. As argument we can either provide input file name. If we just want to read a video from a particular file we will give the file name like myfile.avi maybe OR we can provide the device index of the camera. By deafult it is either 0 or -1. If we have multiple cameras and if we want to use the other camera then we can also try one for the second camera or two for the third camera and so on. 


while(True):                                     #while loop is created to capture the frame continuously and we will run this loop indefinitely. while this loop is true, we want to capture the frames. 


ret, frame = cap.read()                          #So we will just define these variable ret and frame and then using this cap instance we will call a method read. Now this read method is going to return true if the frame is available and this frame will be saved into this frame variable. If the frame is available ret will be true otherwise it will be false and this frame variable will actually capture or save the frame.  


if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):            #We use waitKey to wait for user input. If input is q key quit and destroy all windows

break                                            #Come out of the loop

cap.release()                                    #release the resources

cv2.destroyAllWindows()                          #it destroys all the windows

## To convert video input from coloured to gray
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0); 

while(True):  

ret, frame = cap.read()   


gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)   #To convert our video input from colured to the gray scale image. First argument is source and second argument is conversion which want to do. By default coloured image is captured as BGR channel images.  

cv2.imshow('frame', gray)

if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):

break                                            

cap.release()                                   

cv2.destroyAllWindows() 



### Using cap instance we can read few properties about the video captured
1] whether the video is opened or not. Whenever we provide the file name and the file path is wrong, it will give us false

import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0); 

while(cap.isOpened()):                           #If the file name of the video we want to provide is correct then we get true otherwise isOpened will give us false if path is wrong or index in VideoCapure is wrong.            

ret, frame = cap.read()   


gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)  

cv2.imshow('frame', gray)

if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):

break                                            

cap.release()                                   

cv2.destroyAllWindows()                          

### MAIN CODE:
<
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0); 

while(cap.isOpened()):                           

ret, frame = cap.read()   


gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)  

cv2.imshow('frame', gray)

if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):

break                                            

cap.release()                                   

cv2.destroyAllWindows() 
>
#### NOTE:
use print(cap.isOpened()) to see whether isOpened() gives true or false

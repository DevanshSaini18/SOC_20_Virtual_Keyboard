# Detect Corners with Harris Corner Detector
Corners- Are the region in image with large intensity variation in all directions. It includes three main steps:
1. Detecting windows which produce large variations in intensity in both X, Y directions. Window is the small box and we check for intensity in X and Y direction.
So for a window detected at (X,Y) and let the intensity be I(X,Y) and at some point adjacent point is I(X+u,Y+v). The difference between shifted inensity and original intensity is the difference in the intensities of the windows. And it's very large for a corner. Check at 2:25 for mathematical equations including Taylor series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH8Mq9FPVPw "mathematical equation for corner detection")
2. Compute a score R around each such window. It's gives an estimate of where the point is located based on value of R. R = det(M)-k(trace(M))^2 where M is an intensity derivative (in X, Y direction which can be found using **Sobel method**) matrix. 
3. Apply a threshold to this score to select important corners.
If the value of |R| is very small then the region is flat.
If R<0, then it is an edge.
If R is large, the region is a corner.
```Python
import numpy as np
import cv2
img = cv2.imread("crossboard.jpg") 
cv2.imshow('image', img)
img_gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) #Built-in function for harris detector takes gray scale image (in float32) and better results. 
img_gray = np.float32(img_gray)
dst = cv2.cornerHarris(img_gray, 2, 3, 0.04) #second parameter is block-size that is window-size is block_size square. third parameter is ksize that is the aperture size used for Sobel (used in step 1) and fourth is k which is harris free parameter in the equation. 
dst = cv2.dilate(dst, None) # dilate to get better results.

img[dst>0.01*dst.max()] = [0, 0, 255] #revert back to old image and mark the corners..
cv2.imshow('corner detection', img)

if cv2.waitKey(0) and 0xff==27:
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()```

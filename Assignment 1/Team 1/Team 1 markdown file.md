## Problem Description:
### The question is a collection of data of different cricket matches and then arranging it in dictionary fashion and as a list according to player and their scores.
### Thus the problem requires us to know to about dictionaries and lists in python.
### The data collected is in string format which has to be splitted first between matches, then players. 
### After that it is stored in a dictionary which forms a nested dictionary with player name and corresponding score.
### To print the list of players and their total score across all matches I first got an array of players and their score, and collected their total scoreand deleted the other occurences of same player in the array and converted it to a list.
### Finally I printed the list by sorting it as per the second element of each sublist.

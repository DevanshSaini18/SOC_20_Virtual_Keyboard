# Canny Edge Detector
### The Canny edge detector is used to detect multiple edges in an image (using multi-stage algorithm). 
The detection algorithm is of essentially 5 steps.
1. Noise reduction
2. Gradient calculation
3. Non-max suppression
4. Double Threshold
5. Edge tracking in hysteresis
There is a built-in function for Canny Edge Detection.
```Python
import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
img = cv2.imread('sports.jpg', 0) #read the image in gray-scale.
canny = cv2.Canny(img, 100, 200) 
#We need to provide two threshold values (argument 2 and 3) for hysteresis which is last step. To adjust threshold values add trackbar.
titles =['image', 'canny']
for i in range(2):
    plt.subplot(1,2,i+1)
    plt.imshow(images[i], 'gray')
    plt.title(titles[i])
    plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])
```
Canny Edge detection gives more precise edges and reduces noise as compared to Laplacian or Sobel method.

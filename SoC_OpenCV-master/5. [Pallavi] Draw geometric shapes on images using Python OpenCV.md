# How to draw geometric shapes on images using Python OpenCV

```
import numpy as np
import cv

img = cv2.imread('lena.jpg',0)  #reads an image in gray scale

img = cv2.line(img, (0,0), (255,255), (0,0,255), 5)

cv2.imshow('image',img) #shows an image into a window

cv2.waitKey(0) #wait for closing event
cv2.destroyAllWindows() #destorys all the windows
``` 

### EXPLANATION:
img = cv2.line(img, (0,0), (255,255), (0,0,255), 5) #first argument is image, second is starting coordinates of point 1, third is the ending coordinates of point 2, fourth is the colour and fifth is the thickness. Cordinates are to be given in the form of tuple. Colour is given in the BGR format. (255,0,0) gives blue channel, (0,255,0) gives green channel, (0,0,255) gives red channel. Thickness is provided in numbers. Here we see a black line because the image is loaded in gray scale. To load this image in colored format we will have to change img = cv2.imread('lena.jpg',0) t img = cv2.imread('lena.jpg',1). We can choose colour from google rgb color picker but note that it'll be in reverse order i.e., bgr and rgb.


##### To draw a ray instead of a line use
img = cv2.arrowedLineine(img, (0,0), (255,255), (0,0,255), 5) #all the argyuments are same as that of line class

##### To draw a rectangle
img = cv2.rectangle(img, (384,0), (510,128), (0,0,255), 5) #first argument is image, second is point 1-top left vertex coordinate, third is point 2- bottom right vertex coordinate, fourth is the colour and fifth is the thickness.
